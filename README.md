# Week 11 Assignment 

This repo contains my Week 11 exercise. For this assignment, I worked with a dataset that is directly connected to my course project: the **IMDb Most Popular Movies** dataset. 
Instead of calling the API again, I used the saved CSV file so the notebook can run without any API keys.

## Notebook overview
The notebook `Week_11.ipynb` documents my full data journey using both Python and Markdown, including:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Cleaning and preparing movie data (title, year, rating)
- Aggregating results by release year
- Visualizing:
  - Number of popular movies by year
  - Average IMDb rating by year
- Interpreting trends and reflecting on the data process
